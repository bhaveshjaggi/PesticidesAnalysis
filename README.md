# YieldAnalysis
This project deals with the problem the farmer are facing there are lot of farmers who complain that their crop are not giving proper yield. My main focus is to use machine learning and image processing which will predict the yield using satellite images.
The datascrapping script simply download the images and gml extension file dataset from sentinelsat satellites.
I am still working on this project.
